# puppeteer-nixpacks-buildpack

(Note: This is a Nixpacks adapted version of [Jon Tewksbury's heroku build pack](https://github.com/jontewks/puppeteer-heroku-buildpack/blob/main/README.md))

Installs dependencies needed in order to run [puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) with [nixpacks](https://nixpacks.com) on [railway](https://railway.app) or [hop](https://hop.io). Be sure to include `{ args: ['--no-sandbox', '--disable-setuid-sandbox'] }` and `ignoreDefaultArgs: ['--disable-extensions']` in your call to `puppeteer.launch`.

Puppeteer defaults to `headless: true` in `puppeteer.launch` and this shouldn't be changed. Nixpacks doesn't have a GUI to show you chrome when running `headless: false` and will throw an error.

## Usage

To use add the `nixpacks.toml` file to your root directory before deploying.

This will make the railway nixpacks builder install the needed chrome dependencies listed here:
